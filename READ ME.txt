CSS animations and transitions provided by Daniel Eden from his "Animate.CSS" project found here: https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/
I do not take credit for the code from the file "animate.css", as it strictly belongs to Daniel Eden.

The Lucky 7 logo belongs to Lucky 7 Sniping and Lucky 7 Visions. I only take credit for the render that I did in Cinema 4D with it.

All site resources were created (excluding the L7 logo concept) by Jake Lille (Fleake Graphics).

Note from Fleake Graphics:
